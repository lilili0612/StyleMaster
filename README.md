## Introduction

Welcome to **StyleMaster**! StyleMaster focuses on style control, i.e., generating or translating a video to match the style of a given reference image. StyleMaster preserves local textures and enhance global style representations. Additionally, a motion adapter and gray tile ControlNet are employed to enhance motion quality and provide precise content guidance.

## Features

- **Local Patch Selection**: Overcomes content leakage in style transfer by selecting patches with less similarity to text prompts.
- **Global Style Extraction**: Uses a projection module after CLIP supervised by illusion datasets.
- **Motion Adapter**: Enhances motion quality during inference and helps to enhance the style extent.
- **Gray Tile ControlNet**: Provides accessible yet precise content guidance for video style transfer.
- **High-Quality Video Generation**: Generates videos with high style similarity to the reference image and achieves ideal translation results.

## Illusion Dataset Generation
Please refer to [visual_anagrams/readme.md](visual_anagrams/readme.md) for details.

## Style Extraction
Please refer to [style_extraction](style_extraction_module) for details.
```
cd style_extraction
python style_extraction_module.py
```

## Evaluation results
We show the complete results generated by our method and other baselines in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CZuQuQxs4Y7YSn9pl24U9w8nHh9v1LEX/view?usp=sharing)
